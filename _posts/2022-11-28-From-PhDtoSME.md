## Graduation

This week, I have completed a one-year leadership program offered by Ghent University (Doctoral Schools Office and Postdoc Talent Management) in collaboration with Voka Oost-Vlaanderen (Flandersâ€™ Chamber of Commerce and Industry). 

This program aimed at introducing PhD and PostDoc researchers to the small and medium-sized enterprises world. Together with my teammates (Paulien and Chenxi), we have been visiting Bureau 9000 | Studie- & Energieadviesbureau, as an existing successful example, to apply all the theoretical knowledge in practice.

Thanks to Frank De Craecker for the efforts and the valuable information and to Jolyn De Baets for the guidance and communication during the course.
Thank you Bureau 9000 for the warm welcome we had during every visit.
