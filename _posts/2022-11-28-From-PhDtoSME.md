## Graduation

This week, I have completed a one-year leadership program offered by [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (Doctoral Schools Office and Postdoc Talent Management) in collaboration with [Voka Oost-Vlaanderen](https://www.voka.be/oost-vlaanderen){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (Flanders’ Chamber of Commerce and Industry). 

This program aimed at introducing PhD and PostDoc researchers to the small and medium-sized enterprises world. Together with my teammates (Paulien and Chenxi), we have been visiting [Bureau 9000 Studie & Energieadviesbureau](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bureau-9000---adviesbureau/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as an existing successful example, to apply all the theoretical knowledge in practice.

Thanks to [Frank De Craecker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-de-craecker-3918862/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for the efforts and the valuable information and to [Jolyn De Baets](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolyndebaets/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for the guidance and communication during the course.
Thank you Bureau 9000 for the warm welcome we had during every visit.

## Content

Around 80% of our (post)doctoral researchers continue their careers beyond academia. Business careers differ from academic ones: in business, people typically work in rapidly changing contexts, take considerable risks, focus on attitude rather than on knowledge, and work together with different kinds of profiles.
Ghent University and VOKA East Flanders join forces for the exclusive 'From PhD to SME' programme, the aim of which is to build bridges between the world of research and small and medium-sized enterprises. 16 (post)doctoral researchers are given the unique opportunity to learn more about how SMEs are run and to put this knowledge into practice.

Participants are given a chance to gain first-hand (leadership) experience in a Flemish SME in order to increase their hiring potential and smoothen their transition into the non-academic labour market. In addition, they'll be able to build formal as well as informal networks, and to learn to identify and name their own strengths - maybe their skills and interests match better with business life than they had ever considered?

## Programme

The programme will run from March 2023 through to November 2023.

It consists of the following components:

    a full-day kick off: 03/03/2023, 10:00 - 16:00
    6 modules consisting each of a half-day theoretical session, a practical assignment in an SME, combined with a half-day intervision session

Throughout the programme participants will be supervised by a coach, VOKA East Flanders, as well as the SME they collaborate with. The focus will be on an integral approach of thinking and acting.

Integral approach


 ![Integral approach](/images/2022_11_28_integralapproach.png) 

A. Theoretical sessions
Participants get acquainted with all strategic and tactical dimensions of running a business (strategy, processes, people, etc.)

    Module 1: strategic choices and achievements
    Module 2: leadership - primary process
    Module 3: structures
    Module 4: people
    Module 5: systems
    Module 6: culture

B. Practical assignment in an SME
After each module theory will be put into practice in fixed groups of 4 participants. Each group will be matched with an SME. Based on discussions with the CEO and others within the company participants will give advice and draft an action plan to overcome the SME's strategic and operational challenges.
The 4 SMEs, selected by VOKA East Flanders, are Flemish companies which are currently facing a strategic review, or find themselves in the midst of a reorganisation as a result of rapid growth, or ... What these companies have in common is the need for external input, critical feedback and new ideas.
The 4 groups of (post)doctoral researchers will be formed beforehand in order to ensure optimal heterogeneity and complementarity.

C. Intervision: feedback & reporting on the practical experience
During the half-day intervision sessions the 4 groups will discuss their case with each other and with their coach: in this way participants will broaden their horizons and learn from the experiences collected in other SMEs.
Added value

Co-organised by a non-academic patron, 'From PhD to SME' is a high-yield opportunity for (post)doctoral researchers who are keen to gain valuable professional work experience, much sought-after by their future employers.
