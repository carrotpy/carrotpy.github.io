## Graduation

This week, I have completed a one-year leadership program offered by [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (Doctoral Schools Office and Postdoc Talent Management) in collaboration with [Voka Oost-Vlaanderen](https://www.voka.be/oost-vlaanderen){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (Flandersâ€™ Chamber of Commerce and Industry). 

This program aimed at introducing PhD and PostDoc researchers to the small and medium-sized enterprises world. Together with my teammates (Paulien and Chenxi), we have been visiting [Bureau 9000 Studie & Energieadviesbureau](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bureau-9000---adviesbureau/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as an existing successful example, to apply all the theoretical knowledge in practice.

Thanks to [Frank De Craecker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-de-craecker-3918862/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for the efforts and the valuable information and to [Jolyn De Baets](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolyndebaets/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}for the guidance and communication during the course.
Thank you Bureau 9000 for the warm welcome we had during every visit.
