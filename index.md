title: "About me"

I am a post-doctoral researcher in the field of food toxicology. My research spans from detection of natural toxins, such as mycotoxins and cyanobacterial toxins, in food and water through to the application of -Omics approach to understand the effect of a mixture of toxins and other environmental contaminantes as nanoplastics on humans.

I received my bachelor in Veterinary Medical Sciences from Assiut University, Egypt in 2011. After that, I joined the Pharmaceutical Toxicology Department, Hacettepe University, Turkey in September 2013 (through the _𝑻𝒖𝒓𝒌𝒊𝒔𝒉 𝑮𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒏𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝑺𝒄𝒉𝒐𝒍𝒂𝒓𝒔𝒉𝒊𝒑_) as a masters student and graduated in May 2016. During my masters, I was award an 𝑬𝒓𝒂𝒔𝒎𝒖𝒔+ internship to join the Chemical Risks Group at 𝐼𝑓𝐴𝐷𝑜 Institute in Dortmund, Germany. I conducted my master thesis on mycotoxin analysis through another 𝑬𝒓𝒂𝒔𝒎𝒖𝒔+ exchange scholarship at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU) in Tulln, Austria.


In August 2016, I joined the Centre of Excellence of Mycotoxicology & Public Health, Ghent University, Belgium for my PhD to work on the mitigation of toxigenic fungi and their mycotoxins. My PhD work was part of **Mycokey** project which was funded by the EU Horizon 2020. I joined the Teagasc Food Research Centre in Ashtown, Dublin, Ireland as a research scientist in the framework of the European project 𝗔𝗴𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗼𝘅 from April 2020 until September 2020.


Since October 2020, I am a postdoctoral fellow of the Ghent University-Special Research Fund (BOF) at the Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health.

In 2018, I was awarded the VLIRUOS Global Minds Grant from Ghent University for my side project "MYCOSUGAR" to enrich the knowledge for mycotoxin occurrence in sugarcane as an important cash crop in Africa. I also obtained another VLIRUOS Global Minds Grant from Ghent University for another project "AAF-CYSTIN-milk" to assess the incidence of aflatoxin M1 and microcystin-LR in water buffalo milk from Philippines and their potential _in vitro_ toxic interaction

In 2019, I was awarded the Young Scientist Award during the EURACHEM meeting held in Tartu, Estonia.
