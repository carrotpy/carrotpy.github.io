**Short Bio** (Last update: October 2022).

<br /> I am a post-doctoral researcher in Toxicology field at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en). My research spans from detection of natural toxins, such as mycotoxins and cyanobacterial toxins, in food and water through to the application of -Omics approach to understand the effect of a mixture of toxins and other environmental contaminantes as micro- and nanoplastics on humans.

I received my bachelor in Veterinary Medical Sciences from [Assiut University](https://www.aun.edu.eg/main/) , Egypt in 2011. After that, I joined the Pharmaceutical Toxicology Department, [Hacettepe University](https://www.hacettepe.edu.tr/english), Turkey in September 2013 (through the [TÃ¼rkiye Scholarships](https://www.turkiyeburslari.gov.tr/)) as a masters student and graduated in May 2016. During my masters, I was award an [Erasmus<sup>+</sup>](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/) internship to join the Chemical Risks Group at [_IfADo_](https://www.ifado.de/ifadoen/) Institute in Dortmund, Germany. I conducted my master thesis on mycotoxin analysis through another [Erasmus<sup>+</sup>](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/) exchange scholarship at the [University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna](https://boku.ac.at/en/) (BOKU) in Tulln, Austria.

In August 2016, I joined the Centre of Excellence of Mycotoxicology & Public Health, [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en), Belgium for my PhD to work on the mitigation of toxigenic fungi and their mycotoxins. My PhD work was part of [**Mycokey**](http://www.mycokey.eu/) project which was funded by the EU Horizon 2020. I joined the Teagasc Food Research Centre in Ashtown, Dublin, Ireland as a research scientist in the framework of the European project [**Agritox**](http://agritox.eu/) from April 2020 until September 2020.

Since October 2020, I am a postdoctoral fellow of the [Ghent University-Special Research Fund](https://www.ugent.be/nl/onderzoek/financiering/bof/postdoc/overzicht.htm) (BOF) at the [Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health](https://www.ugent.be/bw/foodscience/en/research#rFoodMicro).

In 2018, I was awarded the [VLIRUOS Global Minds Grant](https://www.ugent.be/en/research/funding/devcoop/globalmindsfund.htm) from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) for my side project "MYCOSUGAR" to enrich our knowledge on mycotoxin occurrence in sugarcane as an important cash crop in Africa. I also obtained another [VLIRUOS Global Minds Grant](https://www.ugent.be/en/research/funding/devcoop/globalmindsfund.htm) for another project "AF-CYSTIN-milk" to assess the incidence of aflatoxin M1 and microcystin-LR in water buffalo milk from Philippines and their potential _in vitro_ toxic interaction.

In 2019, I was awarded the Young Scientist Award during the [EURACHEM 2019](https://eurachem2019.akki.ut.ee/) meeting held in Tartu, Estonia.
