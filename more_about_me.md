In 2018, I was awarded the [VLIRUOS Global Minds Grant](https://www.ugent.be/en/research/funding/devcoop/globalmindsfund.htm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for my side project "MYCOSUGAR" to enrich our knowledge on mycotoxin occurrence in sugarcane as an important cash crop in Africa. I also obtained another [VLIRUOS Global Minds Grant](https://www.ugent.be/en/research/funding/devcoop/globalmindsfund.htm) for another project "AF-CYSTIN-milk" to assess the incidence of aflatoxin M1 and microcystin-LR in water buffalo milk from Philippines and their potential _in vitro_ toxic interaction.
