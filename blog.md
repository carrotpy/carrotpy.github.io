Short Bio (last update: October 2022)

I am a post-doctoral researcher in Toxicology field at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. My research spans from detection of natural toxins, such as mycotoxins and cyanobacterial toxins, in food and water through to the application of -Omics approach to understand the effect of a mixture of toxins and other environmental contaminantes as micro- and nanoplastics on humans.
